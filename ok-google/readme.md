# Ok Google Python Quiz

# The Rules
This challenge is to use python to prompt the user for a question and ask google for an answer.  This is along the lines of the ads that say "ok google how much does the earth weigh?" and google will incorporate the answer into your search results.  Your solution is only expected to work on questions that have a specific answer supplied by google.

Use BeautifulSoup, Scrappy or the tool of your choice to read the results from google.

## Notes
I found that [google instant](http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/instant/about.html) search interferes with the results.
